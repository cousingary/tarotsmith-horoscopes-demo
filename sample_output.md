### Aries Sun Horoscope
2 March – 8 March 2026

Theme: The ram stalls at 11 degrees of Pisces

*The fire wants to go forward. The ground is not there.*

The Sun stands at 11°54' Pisces, peregrine — no dignity, no traction. For Aries, this is not a spiritual condition. It is a mechanical one. The engine that makes you act before others have finished thinking is still running, but the Sun that powers it sits in a sign that dissolves edges, and Aries runs on edges. The Saturn-Neptune conjunction tightening at 1° Aries presses at your Ascendant with the precision of a vice: Saturn demanding form, Neptune dissolving it, both of them installed on the very degree where your nature begins. You are being asked to take the shape of a discipline you cannot yet see clearly, and to do it now.

Mercury and Venus travel with the Sun in Pisces, both feeding signals into your decision-making apparatus that your apparatus was not built to process. Mercury at 21° Pisces turns every calculation impressionistic; you reach for a clean yes or no and come back with a feeling. Venus at 25° Pisces sweetens what you should examine. Mars, your ruler, arrives at 29°55' Aquarius — the last degree, the degree of exhausted systems — driving toward the Aries border it cannot yet cross. Your chart ruler is a foot away from home and stuck. The impulse to act is real. The capacity to land it cleanly is not there yet.

Jupiter at 15° Cancer trines your Sun from the sign of protective accumulation. Something is being held in reserve for you, quietly, in the background of the week's disorder. Chiron at 24° Aries sits in your sign, old wound still open, and Lilith at 8° Sagittarius squares your Sun from the fire of irreverent truth — something you have been refusing to say is still waiting.

Weekly Mandate: Do not mistake momentum for readiness; let Mars cross into Aries before you commit the thing that cannot be uncommitted.

### Scorpio Sun Horoscope
2 March – 8 March 2026

Theme: What cannot be named cannot be controlled

*The deep-water creature rises into murk it did not make and cannot clear.*

The Sun at 11°54' Pisces sits in opposition to your native sign, which means this week the solar light falls on Scorpio from the outside — refracted, diffuse, stripped of the precision your nature requires. You do not control what you cannot see clearly, and this week, the things you have been managing in the dark are losing their edges. The Saturn-Neptune conjunction at 1° Aries quincunxes your Sun with the particular awkwardness of forces that will not resolve: Saturn wants the account settled, Neptune ensures the numbers keep shifting. You reach for the bottom of what someone owes you, or what you owe, and find it has moved.

Mercury at 21° Pisces and Venus at 25° Pisces sit trine your native Scorpio ground, which means what reaches you this week reaches you with unusual ease — softened, made accessible, stripped of the resistance you rely on to know what is real. This is not comfort. For Scorpio, ease around hidden things is a diagnostic problem. The information arriving looks trustworthy. Examine that assumption. Mars at 29° Aquarius squares your Sun from the sign of systems and collectives: an external pressure from an institution, a group, a shared structure, arriving with urgency that feels manufactured but may not be.

Jupiter in Cancer trines your Sun from across the water, offering emotional intelligence as ballast — the knowing in the body that the analytical mind cannot produce this week. The South Node at 8°58' Virgo makes a quincunx to your position, pulling toward old analysis, toward the files you have already worked. The week does not reward what you have already figured out.

Weekly Mandate: Withhold the conclusion you have already reached and sit with the data for three more days before you act on what you think you know.

### Capricorn Sun Horoscope
2 March – 8 March 2026

Theme: The architect confronts the unmeasurable

*You came to build. The blueprint keeps changing under your hands.*

At 11°54' Pisces, the Sun is in sextile to your native sign — the mildest of connections, the kind that offers a door but does not open it for you. Capricorn requires that things be solid: commitments, returns, the known terms of an agreement. This week, the solar energy available to you flows from a sign where nothing stays solid, and the sextile means you can access it if you reach for it deliberately, but left alone it will simply not engage. The Saturn-Neptune conjunction at 1° Aries sits in a semisextile to your Sun — close enough to be felt, awkward enough to produce no clean outcome. Saturn is your ruler, and Saturn this week is fused with Neptune in a sign it does not govern, carrying obligations it cannot discharge cleanly. What you are responsible for is real. The path to fulfilling it is not straight.

Mercury and Venus in Pisces both sextile your sign, which means information and value are available but must be pursued. Mercury at 21° will give you the conversation, the document, the clarifying word — if you go looking for it rather than waiting for it to arrive. Venus at 25° will give you the cooperation, the goodwill — but Pisces Venus is diffuse, and goodwill without structure does nothing for you. Mars at 29° Aquarius makes an irritating, unclassifiable semisextile: urgency from the direction of collective systems, of institutional timelines, of other people's schedules pressing against yours. You cannot ignore it. You cannot fully incorporate it.

Jupiter at 15° Cancer opposes your Sun with the force of protective excess — someone's care for you, or yours for someone else, that has become load-bearing in ways that compromise your structure. Uranus at 27° Taurus trines your Sun from the earth sign of material assets: the innovation arrives from the physical, from the held thing, from the resource already in your hands.

Weekly Mandate: Identify the single deliverable that Saturn still governs in this week's confusion and complete it before you touch anything Neptune has made ambiguous.

## Rising Sign Horoscopes

### Aries Rising
2 March – 8 March 2026

Theme: The locked room at the back of the house

The week lives in the room you keep closed. Your twelfth house — the chamber of undischarged debts, private undoings, and what you will not say aloud — fills with the Sun, Mercury, Venus, and the North Node, all of them at once, illuminating what you have been successfully not looking at. This is not a gentle reckoning. The twelfth house does not surface things gently. It surfaces them suddenly, in the middle of something else, at the wrong moment.

Mars, your chart ruler, stands at 29°55' Aquarius in your eleventh house, the territory of alliances, collective projects, and the future you are building with other people. It is one degree from home, one degree from Aries, and it cannot cross yet. Your ruler is at maximum tension in a sign that demands systemic detachment while everything in your twelfth house demands personal reckoning. The Moon at 29°41' Leo sits in your fifth house — children, creative risks, the gambles you take for love — and opposes Mars across the chart's axis. The confrontation between what you have invested emotionally and what your alliances actually cost is exact, loud, and cannot be deferred. Uranus in Taurus squares both from your second house: the financial structure of what you have built with others is the point of instability.

Saturn and Neptune conjoin at 1° Aries directly on your Ascendant. The face you present to the world is being restructured. Saturn demands a new form of self-presentation; Neptune dissolves the one you have been using. You do not yet know what the new one is. Jupiter in Cancer in your fourth house holds the home stable — protective, quietly generous — while everything above it shifts.

The week's axis is the hidden versus the collective: what you carry alone in the twelfth and what you are building with others in the eleventh. What you do not discharge privately will destabilise the alliance publicly.

Mandate: Before the week ends, name the undischarged obligation in your closest working partnership and bring it into the room where both of you are present.

### Scorpio Rising
2 March – 8 March 2026

Theme: The domestic wall develops a crack

The crack appears on Tuesday. It sounds like a conversation about money, but it is a conversation about power — specifically, who has agreed to carry what, and whether that agreement still holds.

Your Sun rules your tenth house, the house of public reputation and professional standing, and this week it sits in your fifth house — the territory of creative risk, personal investment, and what you have chosen to love. The Sun's conjunction with the North Node there marks a fated convergence: what you have put your heart into is being pulled toward your career's axis whether you planned for that or not. Something private is about to become professionally consequential. Mars and Pluto, your chart's dual rulers, occupy your fourth house — the foundation, the family dwelling, the inheritance of your earliest formation. Mars at 29° Aquarius is at maximum pressure. Pluto in Aquarius holds its ground in the same terrain. The domestic sphere is where the week's real force concentrates. Mars opposes the Moon across your tenth house axis: your professional reputation and your private life are in direct, visible conflict. Something you have been keeping separate will not stay separate.

Saturn and Neptune conjoin in your sixth house — daily routine, the body's labour, the work that does not appear in the portfolio. Their conjunction there brings a cold assessment of what your ordinary days actually cost you, physically and structurally. Uranus in your seventh house squares both Moon and Mars: the partnership you thought was stable produces an unexpected break, a revision of terms, a recalibration that lands without warning mid-week.

Venus and Mercury in your fifth house alongside the Sun sharpen the communication: contracts, commitments, and conversations that reach across the domestic-professional divide arrive in writing and require written answers.

The week ends differently than it begins. The fourth house and the tenth house are being reconciled by force.

Mandate: Put in writing, before Friday, what you and your domestic partner or co-habitant each carry going forward — the agreement that has been running on assumption must now run on terms.

### Capricorn Rising
2 March – 8 March 2026

Theme: The debt collector arrives at the family table

The week opens on a conversation that has been forming for three months in the structure of your third house — the terrain of siblings, near neighbours, local obligations, the sentence left unfinished. The Sun, Mercury, Venus, and the North Node occupy this house together. Every meeting, errand, and exchange this week carries weight. What you say to the person across the table will be used later.

Saturn, your chart ruler, stands in your fourth house — the foundation, the family dwelling, the account that runs beneath everything else. Saturn in Aries is in detriment: your ruler's structural authority is operating in a sign that wants to act before the structure is ready, in a house that requires long-term patience. Neptune conjoins it there, and the conjunction produces a particular difficulty for Capricorn Rising: the domestic foundation that your entire chart rests upon is both real and unclear at the same time. You know there are obligations in the house. You cannot get a clean number on what they are. Mars in your second house — personal income, owned assets, what you have earned and hold — opposes the Moon in your eighth house: what someone else owes you, or what you owe into a shared structure, is the week's sharpest edge. The opposition is exact. The conversation about money that the domestic terrain requires cannot be deferred past Thursday.

Uranus in your fifth house squares both Moon and Mars from the terrain of personal risk: the creative investment, the child, the gamble you made for reasons that felt personal, produces the disruption. Jupiter in your seventh house — the partner, the formal alliance — sits in opposition to your Sun, which means the person across the contract from you has more information, more goodwill, or more leverage than you have accounted for. That is useful, if you go and find out what it is.

The week's reckoning is between the family table and the ledger — what the house has accumulated, what the house now owes, and who in the family has been pretending otherwise.

Mandate: Arrange the conversation about the shared financial obligation in the family home before Sunday — in person, at the table, with the actual numbers present.
